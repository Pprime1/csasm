**Code-Review 0.0.16 Branch #30**
      -merged 16 November 2021
- [x] Code review by someone ... Andrew!!
  - [x] There are a few occasions where storage of items in local storage looks excessive, there might be a purpose that I'm missing ... needed in reward.ejs
  - [x] Communicating with the map via global variables is bad practice. Goal is to have minimal global variables. 
  - [x] from a gameplay perspective - clearing the local storage on reward so quickly might cause issues aka maybe they close their phone and it refreshes the browser window.. then they lose the information and have to play the game again. sucks to be them then.
  - [x] personally, I would have had the map start-up with minimal logic related to our app 
  - [x] Expose map via global variable object? (like jQuery's $ function). We would then be able to call it via that function to make changes from our client.js.. e.g $MAP.update_table(...), $MAP.update_player(...) - it is working fine as it is
  - [x] Merging the two js files is a bad idea, making the code more complex, and if you decide in future that the map isn't working it makes removing much harder.
- [x] the map updates on a 5 second loop. Can it be called from watchposition(success,,) instead now?
  - [x] call the updatemap function (at least) from within the watchposition function in client.js - and therefore it would update constantly as the player moves around. 
  - [x] this is ok: Constant database update calls and all else happening rather than a more staid every 5 seconds is acceptable and normal
  - [x] code restructure to call all of startupmap inside client.js as well
- [ ]ðŸ‘Ž How to deal with user making the map fullscreen? Can no longer see/scroll outside of the map. 
  - [ ]ðŸ‘Ž Could use two-finger dragging for map movements, but that fails with the panBtn logic ... probably not fixable 
  - [x] Try a 80% width for map, but then user can just zoom further. still breaks!
- [x] how to have a development environment that is seperate from the production environment in case I want to make changes once we are live
  - [x] csasm is now pipeline to 'staging' and 'production' is now named asmhub
  - [x] Production promotion fails every time. (see https://github.com/Pprime1/csasm/issues/29)


**GCALPHATEST 0.0.15 Branch #28**
      -merged 28 October 2021
- [x] create a live, outdoors, example for testing:= GCALPHATST
  - [x] iphone testing
  - [x] accuracy of location ... watchposition gives best accuracy
  - [x] watchposition allows the player location actually update (see https://github.com/Pprime1/csasm/issues/27)
  - [ ] the map updates on a 5 second loop. Can it be called from watchposition(success,,) instead now?
    - [ ] is this even wise? Constant database update calls and all else happening rather than a more staid every 5 seconds
    - [ ] code restructure would be needed to place at least updatemap if not all of createmap inside client.js
  - [x] the playericon image was too hard to spot. now is a bright yellow background
  - [x] usability for navigation from a distance
    - [x] I don't feel there is value in creating a 'line' from playerLoc to each of the target circles? Can't easily tell which one they are going to so would have to be 2 (or more) directional lines which would look silly
  - [x] usability for navigationing when close. Zoom level is good
    - [x] jitter an issue? Once in the circle has to stay there until the other circles register as occupied as well.
- [x] review console.logs to ensure it's useful and not overly communicative
  - [x] when player leaves a circle console.log now notes that.
- [x] Quit game redirecting to geocaching.com website
- [x] Zooming switches on pauseAutoMove - detect currentmove flag needed again.
- [x] pauseAutoMove turning itself off immediately after turning it back on - detect currentmove flag needed again.
- [x] Leave room is not working properly - it is not properly updating playercount as per what it tells client. Is working in server.. 
  - [x] Table player_count is not updating after a player leaves (ie: 2 back down to 1)
  - [x] On leave room if there are now zero players do some form of end-game acknowledgement?
- [x] moved the Quit button below the map - or into the footer bar?

**panTo-Control-button 0.0.14 Branch #26**
      -merged 15 October 2021
- [x] zoom map further in than 50m
- [x] a toggle button on whether to pan the map or not
  - [x] change the button icon to reveal what mode it is in
  - [x] mousehover screen tooltip
- [x] a QUIT GAME button to properly stop it

**LIVE-MAP 0.0.13 Branch #25**
      -merged 12 October 2021
- [ ] reintroduce validatechecksums = true for the database tables. how to set/reset md5 values? (see https://github.com/Pprime1/csasm/issues/15)
- [x] Include some form of live map view on the screen cf: https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/
  - [x] Centre on the current player's location
  - [x] Have Circles for each waypoint
    - [x] needs to convert geometry waypoint locations to WKT
    - [x] need to update the colour of them with updatemap updates
    - [x] colour the circle yellow if anyone is occupying, colour it green if current player is occupying, otherwise red when not occupied by anyone
  - [x] map update/pan on movement?
  - [x] make the displayed map bigger on screen? 1000px height x full device-width ==> set in the css stylesheet
      - do we show other players on map? ... no:sleeping_bed:
  - [x] delay showmap.js from starting until the game actually starts
    - [x] why doesn't the actual map tiles display by default at startup? Maybe delay first display until is_running? 
  - [x] change the person marker icon to be a person 
    - [x] simplify the icon URL ... use '/js/personicon.png' not '../../personicon.png' 
  - [ ] can we zoom map further in than 50m?
  - [ ] Can we have a toggle on whether to pan the map or not?
  - [x] clear the playerloc pin once it updates?
  - [x] iphone testing
- [x] document/diagram of code flow
- [x] can Heroku auto-restart the dyno on application crash?
   - it does usually. https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos
   - only usecase it doesn't is a crashed build (eg: attemnpt to build whilst a player still active)
- [x] I don't care? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47581575/only-request-geolocation-information-in-response-to-a-user-gesture/49406009#49406009
- [x] track down all the todo's from earlier branches and store them in a seperate file perhaps? There is a bit of a history of development emerging here

      -merged 19 Jul 2021
- [x] Routine to check if chosen game is a valid one, and to error/restart if not
- [x] Check the timeouts - time to refresh player location (should be 5000ms?), refresh room contents (should be 10000ms?)
- [x] Throw players to an error when they do not allow locations to be grabbed, and inform them how to fix this.
- [x] Check that update location is actually updating - inside house tests it is never changing location
- [x] Only display Reward to those players currently occupying any waypoint (thwart game-jumpers)
- [x] Once Reward is displayed, stop all screen and location updates
- [x] grab the Game Description and display it
- [ ] reintroduce validatechecksums = true for the database tables. how to set/reset md5 values?
- [ ] Is it possible to include some form of live map view on the screen? cf: https://github.com/googlemaps/js-samples/blob/master/dist/samples/map-geolocation/index.js
- [x] Can we start the game directly to a pre-filled GC code eg: https://csasm.herokuapp.com/?GCTEST ?

**IMPLEMENT VISION v0.0.01**
- 1 - geocache table contains information about points of interest - e.g "Andrews Place"... if we wanted we could add a third table to link them to a "GCCODE" then look for all players updated in last 5 minutes and see whether they're near any of the places for our GCCODE, if any are send that as an update to all users for same GCCODE 2.2 - When all players occupy the correct locations send further information in the "distance" update to congratulate them?

- 2A - Implement a "which game' feature, possibly as a command line call ie: https://csasm.herokuapp.com/?GCCODE
- 2B - Compare current player's location to both waypoint locations in the ASM table for the current 'game' ... display distance from each, and display current time as reference
- 2C - IF player is closer to either waypoint location than the specified 'radius' distance, then update the timestamp of that waypoint to current time
- 2D - AND THEN check if the timestamp for the other waypoint location is also within 30 seconds of current time, if it is then both locations are occupied, = SUCCESS
- 2E - IF NOT SUCCESS, display an encouragement message and re-poll
- 2F - IF SUCCESS, ie: both waypoint locations are currently occupied by a player, THEN display SUCCESS MESSAGE and halt.

- 3 Budget Concerns - Postgres allows for 10k rows, we store player information in the database whilst they're connected. 
  - This means we are allowed to have (10k - geocache.rows - othertables.rows) players 
  - This should be tracked to whether it is still appropriate

# csasm
This is the source code repository for the Geocaching Anti-Social Mob application (ASM) - aka Covid Safe Anti-Social Mob (csasm).
The app runs on multiple mobile devices, each connecting to the same source to determine if they are within a proximity radius of any waypoint location stored in a database table for a given Game-Code.
If so, returns hidden REWARD text value (clues/directions to the final container). Otherwise restart the process (polling) to see if anything has changed.


# TODO

- XRoutine to check if chosen game is a valid one, and to error/restart if notX
- XCheck the timeouts - time to refresh player location (should be 5000ms?), refresh room contents (should be 10000ms?)X
- XThrow players to an error when they do not allow locations to be grabbed, and inform them how to fix this.X
- XCheck that update location is actually updating - inside house tests it is never changing locationX
- XOnly display Reward to those players currently occupying any waypoint (thwart game-jumpers)X
- XOnce Reward is displayed, stop all screen and location updatesX
- Xgrab the Game Description and display itX
8. reintroduce validatechecksums = true for the database tables. how to set/reset md5 values?
9. Is it possible to include some form of live map view on the screen? cf: https://github.com/googlemaps/js-samples/blob/master/dist/samples/map-geolocation/index.js
- XCan we start the game directly to a pre-filled GC code eg: https://csasm.herokuapp.com/?GCTEST ?X


# Key files

[SERVER.JS](/server.js) : the primary engine (server side javascript creates and runs index.ejs) - no visibility of goings on to enduser (can only be seen in heroku console). Must socket.emit to communicate to client side javascript

[CLIENT.JS](/public/js/client.js) : the primary controller (client side javascript called from index.ejs) - visible in console (F12). 

[INDEX.EJS](/views/pages/index.ejs) : the calling script (client side html) to display stuff  - visible in console (F12).

[REWARD.EJS](/views/pages/reward.ejs) : the final reward display script (client side html) - visible in console (F12).



## Running Locally 
... unreliable still. code doesn't stay in sync with github?

```
heroku login -i \\ userID is prefilled but type the password
heroku pg:psql -a csasm \\ for database commands
```

### Installing
Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/) installed.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Pprime1/csasm # or clone your own fork
$ cd csasm
$ npm install
$ heroku local
```
Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

### Deploying to Heroku

```
$ heroku git:remote -a csasm
$ git push heroku main
$ heroku open
```

# csasm
This is the source code repository for the Geocaching Anti-Social Mob application (ASM) - aka Covid Safe Anti-Social Mob (csasm).
The app runs on multiple mobile devices, each connecting to the same source to determine if they are within a proximity radius of any waypoint location stored in a database table for a given Game-Code.
If so, returns hidden REWARD text value (clues/directions to the final container). Otherwise restart the process (polling) to see if anything has changed.


# TODO
- [ ] reintroduce validatechecksums = true for the database tables. how to set/reset md5 values? (see https://github.com/Pprime1/csasm/issues/15)
- [x] can we zoom map further in than 50m?
- [ ] Can we have a toggle on whether to pan the map or not? 
- [x] create a live, outdoors, example for testing
  - [x] iphone testing
  - [ ] accuracy of location ... 13m?
  - [ ] usability for navigation from a distance
  - [ ] usability for navigationing when close
  - [ ] jitter?
  - [ ] does it work with multiple games?
  - [ ] check that no reward if not occupying a circle
  - [ ] review console.logs to ensure it's useful and not overly communicative
- [ ] how to have a development environment that is seperate from the production environment
- [ ] Leave room is not working properly - it is not properly updating playercount. 
  - [ ] Table player_count is not updating after a player leaves (ie: 2 back down to 1)
  - [ ] On leave room if there are now zero players do some form of end-game acknowledgement

- [ ] Hide a container, create a real one

# Key files

[SERVER.JS](/server.js) : the primary engine (server side javascript creates and runs index.ejs) - no visibility of goings on to enduser (can only be seen in heroku console). Must socket.emit to communicate to client side javascript

[CLIENT.JS](/public/js/client.js) : the primary controller (client side javascript called from index.ejs) - visible in console (F12). 

[SHOWMAP.JS](/public/js/showmap.js) : the map code (client side javascript called from index.ejs) - visible in console (F12).

## Running Locally 
... unreliable still. code doesn't stay in sync with github?

```
heroku login -i \\ userID is prefilled but type the password
heroku pg:psql -a csasm \\ for database commands
```

### Installing
Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/) installed.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Pprime1/csasm # or clone your own fork
$ cd csasm
$ npm install
$ heroku local
```
Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

### Deploying to Heroku

```
$ heroku git:remote -a csasm
$ git push heroku main
$ heroku open
```

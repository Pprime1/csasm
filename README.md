# csasm
This is the source code repository for the Geocaching Anti-Social Mob application (ASM) - aka Covid Safe Anti-Social Mob (csasm).
The app runs on multiple mobile devices, each connecting to the same source to determine if they are within a proximity radius of any waypoint location stored in a database table for a given Game-Code.
If so, returns hidden REWARD text value (clues/directions to the final container). Otherwise restart the process (polling) to see if anything has changed.


# TODO
- [x] create a live, outdoors, example for testing:= GCALPHATST
  - [x] iphone testing
  - [x] accuracy of location ... watchposition gives best accuracy
  - [x] watchposition allows the player location actually update (see https://github.com/Pprime1/csasm/issues/27)
  - [ ] the map updates on a 5 second loop. Can it be called from watchposition(success,,) instead now?
    - [ ] is this even wise? Constant database update calls and all else happening rather than a more staid every 5 seconds
    - [ ] code restructure would be needed to place at least updatemap if not all of createmap inside client.js
  - [x] the playericon image was too hard to spot. now is a bright yellow background
  - [x] usability for navigation from a distance
    - [x] I don't feel there is value in creating a 'line' from playerLoc to each of the target circles? Can't easily tell which one they are going to so would have to be 2 (or more) directional lines which would look silly
  - [x] usability for navigationing when close. Zoom level is good
    - [x] jitter an issue? Once in the circle has to stay there until the other circles register as occupied as well.
- [x] review console.logs to ensure it's useful and not overly communicative
  - [x] when player leaves a circle console.log now notes that.
- [x] Quit game redirecting to geocaching.com website
- [x] Zooming switches on pauseAutoMove - detect currentmove flag needed again.
- [x] pauseAutoMove turning itself off immediately after turning it back on - detect currentmove flag needed again.
- [x] Leave room is not working properly - it is not properly updating playercount as per what it tells client. Is working in server.. 
  - [x] Table player_count is not updating after a player leaves (ie: 2 back down to 1)
  - [x] On leave room if there are now zero players do some form of end-game acknowledgement?
- [x] moved the Quit button below the map - or into the footer bar?
- [ ] how to have a development environment that is seperate from the production environment in case I want to make changes once we are live
- [ ] reintroduce validatechecksums = true for the database tables. how to set/reset md5 values? (see https://github.com/Pprime1/csasm/issues/15)
- [ ] Code review by someone ... Andrew!
- [ ] create GCBetaTst at QUT - run the test cases with 3 players
  - [ ] check that no reward if not occupying a circle
  - [ ] Multiple players at one circle at same time works at all?
    - [ ] Do all get the reward?
- [ ] create GCGammaTst (3 waypoints) also at QUT - run the test cases with 5 players
  - [ ] does it work properly with 3 target circles?
  - [ ] does it work with multiple concurrent games? (along with GCBetaTst)
      - [ ] do seperate correct rewards happen to the right players?
- [ ] Hide a container, create a real one: 
  - [ ] delete GCTest, GCAlbury as they have private locations
    - [ ] keep GCBetaTst and GCGammaTst for future code testing. QUT is safe ground
  - [ ] 'replace' GCAlphatst with the real GC code. Or possibly just duplicate locations
  - [ ] Write and refine what user instructions are needed - into listing, but also should it be in the code somewhere?
    - [ ] OBC co-ownership on the listing?
  - [ ] remove default game from form
  - [ ] Final production test run, before publishing for real. Use two new people.
  - [ ] Production Release!
 

# Key files

[SERVER.JS](/server.js) : the primary engine (server side javascript creates and runs index.ejs) - no visibility of goings on to enduser (can only be seen in heroku console). Must socket.emit to communicate to client side javascript

[INDEX.EJS](/views/pages/index.ejs) : the calling script (client side html) to display stuff  - visible in console (F12).

[CLIENT.JS](/public/js/client.js) : the primary controller (client side javascript called from index.ejs) - visible in console (F12). 

[SHOWMAP.JS](/public/js/showmap.js) : the map code (client side javascript called from index.ejs) - visible in console (F12). 

[REWARD.EJS](/views/pages/reward.ejs) : the final reward display script (client side html) - visible in console (F12).



## Running Locally 
... unreliable still. code doesn't stay in sync with github?

```
heroku login -i \\ userID is prefilled but type the password
heroku pg:psql -a csasm \\ for database commands
```

### Installing
Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/) installed.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Pprime1/csasm # or clone your own fork
$ cd csasm
$ npm install
$ heroku local
```
Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

### Deploying to Heroku

```
$ heroku git:remote -a csasm
$ git push heroku main
$ heroku open
```
or

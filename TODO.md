**ERROR-HANDLING branch**
      -merged 19 Jul 2021
-[x] Routine to check if chosen game is a valid one, and to error/restart if not
-[x] Check the timeouts - time to refresh player location (should be 5000ms?), refresh room contents (should be 10000ms?)
-[x] Throw players to an error when they do not allow locations to be grabbed, and inform them how to fix this.
-[x] Check that update location is actually updating - inside house tests it is never changing location
-[x] Only display Reward to those players currently occupying any waypoint (thwart game-jumpers)
-[x] Once Reward is displayed, stop all screen and location updates
-[x] grab the Game Description and display it
-[] reintroduce validatechecksums = true for the database tables. how to set/reset md5 values?
-[] Is it possible to include some form of live map view on the screen? cf: https://github.com/googlemaps/js-samples/blob/master/dist/samples/map-geolocation/index.js
-[x] Can we start the game directly to a pre-filled GC code eg: https://csasm.herokuapp.com/?GCTEST ?
